# dash-test-app
A testing ground for Dash app development including app features and experimenting with dashboard visualizations.

### Install Project Locally
Follow the instructions for a development role of **Collaborator**. See the ***Detailed Steps - Collaborator*** section in [data_project_installation_instructions.md](/notes/data_project_installation_instructions.md). Note that there is also a ***High Level Steps - Collaborator*** section with an overview of the steps needed to install the project.

### Run App Locally
Follow the instructions in section ***Dash App (Plotly Dash Website)*** in [data_project_workflows.md](/notes/data_project_workflows.md).

### Requirements
The project requires a python environment as defined by the combination of the [environment.yml](environment.yml) and [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) files (conda and poetry are not required to create the environment, use whatever environment manager and package installer you prefer). The project also requires node to be installed in order to install the javascript dependencies (for this project just tailwindcss related ones).
