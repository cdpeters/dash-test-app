    """Update a utility class string by removing and/or adding classes.

    Removes/adds utility classes from/to the `current_classes` string. At least one of
    the arguments `remove_classes` or `add_classes` must be provided. These arguments
    are given in the form of a list of strings representing the classes to be removed or
    added.

    If an incoming add class has a prefix that matches a class(es) in the
    `current_classes` string, a warning will be shown but the add will still be
    completed. The warning is there to make it known that the addition of the class
    could override these prefix matched existing classes in the `current_classes`
    string. The developer should evaluate the add and ensure that this is not the case.
    It is possible that there is no overriding behavior even when there are multiple
    classes with the same prefix. If this is the case, the warning can be suppressed by
    setting the `ignore_prefix_warning` to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    current_classes : str
        Current utility class string.
    remove_classes : list[str] | None, optional
        Classes to be removed, by default None.
    add_classes : list[str] | None, optional
        Classes to be added, by default None.
    ignore_prefix_warning : bool, optional
        Flag for suppressing the prefix warning, by default False.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Updated utility class string.
